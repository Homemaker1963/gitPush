"Updates were rejected: use the --force"

Why are we still coding with computers? Since the advent of mobile technology and wearables, we've started to explore the possiblities of using more natural actions to control the digital world around us. Suddenly, the boundaries between daydreams and reality has diminished. So again... why are we still coding with computers?

Enter gitPush. Just like many other kids out there, we wanted to be able to code like a Jedi, able to move walls of code with a mere push. Many hackers have the phrases "git add / git commit / git push" in their muscle memory, so why not do that with the flick of a wrist? We used the LeapMotion API to turn the ordinary coder into a code Jedi. When you open your hand above the LeapMotion, you add all the code that you've modified. When you close your hand, you commit all of the changes you've made. Finally, git push just like you'd guess: with a push. 

Once you git push, you never go back.
